# DESCRIPTION
This is a C# WPF project that I made for fun. I've never tried making a windows app GUI before, so I learned a lot while doing this!

# FUNCTIONALITY
Simply, you select your image, select the function (only view metadata for this project), and click the run button for the task to be run. If the export box is checked, then the metadata information will be stored in a file called imagename_METADATA.txt

# SCREENSHOTS
The main window, before any selections are made.
